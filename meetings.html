At the meetings we not only learn more about the Village in which we live, we also enjoy  the fellowship of our neighbors and fellow residents.  Ample time for socialization is available both before and after the formal meeting, as members share refreshments and casual conversation.  <br /> <br />

The Service Club meets on the third Thursday evening of September thru May.  The normal agenda is:
