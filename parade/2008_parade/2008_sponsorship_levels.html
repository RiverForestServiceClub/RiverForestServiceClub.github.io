The River Forest Service Club and The River Forest Park District are again partnering to present the annual <b>River Forest Memorial Day Parade</B>. <br /> <br />

It is the generosity of many contributors that make this event possible for our community. Contributions are being sought to offset the many expenses that include marching bands, entertainment, staging, public address system, food & beverage, washroom facilities, printing & advertising, etc. 
It is worth noting here that the 2007 parade cost more than $17,000 to present. 
Most expenses are incurred even if the parade is cancelled or scaled back due to inclement weather.  <br /> <br />

Contributions can be made by check, or in the form of significant product or service donations.  In return for your organization’s support, we offer a variety of publicity opportunities.  The level of your contribution, and its timeliness, directly affect the visibility of your business in our pre-parade advertising, the official Parade Program and parade follow-up materials and press releases.  <br /> <br />

Contributions Levels are:
