The purpose of the River Forest Memorial Day Parade is "<b>To recognize and honor the men and women who are serving or who have served in the armed forces of the United States of America, and especially those who gave their lives in serving</b>."

<br />
The annual Memorial Day Parade is the foremost community-wide celebration in River Forest.  Each year more than one hundred businesses, community and civic groups participate in the parade, which draws thousands of viewers from River Forest and surrounding villages.  Grand Marshals in past years have included officers from Great Lakes, including admirals, a World War II ace fighter pilot, and other dignitaries.<br /> <br />

For many years the parade has featured a Riderless Horse to honor our country’s fallen heroes.  There have been as many as eight musical groups in  a single parade. Past parades have included the Great Lakes Naval Center Marching Band, drum and bugle corps, calliope, and local area high school marching bands. Additional participants have included Civil War re-enactors, numerous floats, Model “A” Fords, antique military vehicles, the National Flag Truck, clowns, neighborhood groups, scout troops, politicians, local businesses, and of course, fire trucks.<br /> <br /> 

The community gathering in Keystone Park following the parade begins with a special ceremony featuring comments from the Grand Marshal, and the honoring of local veterans.  Afterwards, members of the River Forest Service Club serve over 2000 free hotdogs to ceremony attendees.
