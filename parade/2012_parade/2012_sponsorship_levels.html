The River Forest Service Club and River Forest Park District are proud to present the 2011 River Forest Memorial Day Parade and Community Picnic 
on Monday, May 28th, with the parade starting at 10:00am.<br /> <br />

Last year, over 100 entries participated in the parade, with thousands of residents lining the route, making this day one of the highlights 
of the year in the Village of River Forest. This event is entirely supported by community contributions. 
An $18,000 annual budget for this event supports the expenses incurred to host the parade (marching bands, entertainment, marketing), 
the community picnic (food and beverage), and the memorial ceremony (stage and PA system).  <br /> <br /> </font>
