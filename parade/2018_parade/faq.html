<p class="faq-question">
Don't like your parade position?
<p class="faq-answer">
We can't stress how much work goes into the parade line-up in order to provide a balanced and cohesive show for those thousands of faces lining the parade route. We recognize that not all will like their parade line-up placement, but you must realize that the front, middle, and end of the parade are all import to us &mdash; that's what makes for a good parade. Thank you for your cooperation.
