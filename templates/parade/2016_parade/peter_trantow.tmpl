Peter C. Trantow --- the 2016 Grand Marshall --- describes his US Army service:
</p>
<p>
I married my college sweetheart, Martha Lounsbury on August 23, 1969 in River Forest, IL.  We both graduated from the University of Wisconsin in January 1970.  I lost my 2S (college deferment classification) and not wanting to go to VietNam, got on a waiting list for the Army National Guard in Madison, WI.  It turned out to be the smart choice, because soon after, the first ever draft lottery was held and my number was 58.  The Selective service called numbers 1-60.
</p><p>
It was not until June 8, of that summer, that my orders were cut to be sent to Basic Training at Ft. Lewis, WA.  I became the 4th squad leader in my platoon, and was asked to lead the platoon in the building of a training path through the woods on the base, and led daily runs on that path.  I was one of 5 men in the Company who maximized the Physical Combat Training Test at the end of Basic Training.  
</p><p>
I moved on to Advanced Individual Training (AIT) at Ft Lewis, and with only 7 days to go, my father died, and I was sent home on a 3- day emergency leave.  I returned to WA and processed out with an Honorable Discharge and my DD214 discharge papers as a Clerk Typist, MOS 70A10.
</p><p>
I came home and joined the 425th Transportation Brigade in Forest Park, IL, where I attended monthly meetings, and spent 2 weeks each summer at &ldquo;Summer Camp&rdquo;, in various locations, such as, Camp Pickett, VA, Camp (now Fort) McCoy, WI, and Ft. Riley, KS.
I transferred to the 305th Psychological Operations Battalion at O'Hare Field, and drove a tractor trailer rig with a huge printing press to Ft. Riley, KS one summer.
</p><p>
I completed my military obligation in June of 1976 with a rank of Staff Sergeant, having been promoted one rank for each year of service. The Army experience taught me discipline and respect for authority. I am still in contact with several of the guys, with which I served after all these years.
